# Data Science Blog Post - Seattle AirBnB

## Project Overview 
For this project, you will pick a dataset. Inspired by Robert, there are a few public datasets from AirBnB available below, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data.

Seattle AirBNB Data
The Seattle AirBnB homes data can be used at the above link. You might pair this with the Boston AirBnB data, which can be found at the link below.

Choose A Dataset of Your Own
You are welcome to use Kaggle or another platform (or your own data) to create a blog and Github post instead of using the datasets discussed above.

Key Steps for Project
Feel free to be creative with your solutions, but do follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.

1) Pick a dataset.

2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

Prepare data:

Gather necessary data to answer your questions
Handle categorical and missing data
Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
Analyze, Model, and Visualize

Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.
4) Communicate your business insights:

Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience

## 1. Technical Requirements (Important Python Packages)

  - Collections
  - Matplotlib
  - NLTK
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Sklearn
  
## 2. Project Motivation
  -- How does the season affect pricing in Seattle? 
  -- How does the neighborhood affect the pricing in Seattle? 
  -- How do the property types within neighbourhoods affect the price? 
  -- How can we use user reviews to group them together? 
  -- Can we create a scale of positive and negative reviews based on neighbourhood? 
  -- Are there specific things we can look at in the negative reviews to see if there business can beneift from changing something? 
## 3. Files Needed
  - listings.csv -- Includes listing information details
  - calendar.csv -- Includes listings price and availabilty
  - reviews.csv -- Includes user reviews of listings
## 4. Summary
Conclusion:
The highest booking rates would be houses or apartments in the Southeast Magnolia or Portage Bay area during the summer months, so in order to mitigate costs or also prevent everything to be fully booked then it would be wise to book early.
